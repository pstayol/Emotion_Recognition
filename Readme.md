Assignment for Machine Learning course
Datasets Used ->EmoVDB-> https://openslr.org/115/ 
              ->AESDD-> https://mega.nz/folder/0ShVXY7C#-73kVoK05OjTPEA95UUvMw
              
              
The AESDD dataset is used to train-test Machine learning models ->  Dataset_AESDD.ipynb


The EmoVDB dataset is used to train-test Machine learning models -> Dataset_emovdb.ipynb


Combination of the two datasets is used to train-test Machine learning models -> Dataset_emovdb+AESDD.ipynb

For the third case we have used from the second dataset the emotions-classes:"happiness,anger,disgust"
and from the first dataset the emotions-classes:"amused,anger,disgust" together. 
The assumption that has been made is that "amused" and "happiness" is the same class.
